# BUCKLE-Benchmark Fact-Checking
This benchmark continues our previous work **[P. Huynh, P. Papotti, 2017](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr/publication/5468/download/data-publi-5468.pdf)** on fact checking by providing the first comprehensive and publicly available infrastructure for evaluating fact checking methods across a wide range of assumption about the facts and the reference information.

It is an addition material of the publication "A Benchmark for Fact Checking Algorithms Built on Knowledge Bases", from **[P. Huynh, P. Papotti](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/publication/5996/download/data-publi-5996.pdf)**, accepted to International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), 2019
